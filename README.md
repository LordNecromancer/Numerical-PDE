# Numerical-PDE
This project solves Laplace equation using SOR method


the basis of the code was found on github.it used Gauss-Seidel method and didn't incorporate tolerance.
I refined the code to use tolerance and use SOR method instead.

this project was initiated as an extra work for engineering mathematics course. and I may add more functionalities and present it 
for my numerical analysis course.
